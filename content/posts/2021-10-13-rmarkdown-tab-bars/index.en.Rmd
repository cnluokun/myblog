## R Markdown

中文支持\\
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
## Markdown {.tabset}
### Plots
```{r, fig.dim=c(5, 3)}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .5, .1))
plot(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars, pch = 19)
```

### Tables
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
